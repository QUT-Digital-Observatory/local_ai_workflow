1,a,"I was on James Street near the bank when I observed a highly unusual and distressing event. At around 4:20 pm, just as the bank was about to close, I noticed three individuals entering the bank. Each of them was armed and had a distinctive appearance. One person carried a shotgun and wore a mask resembling Bill Clinton. Another individual, armed with a rifle, wore a Captain Kirk mask, and the third, holding a sword, had a Dolly Parton mask. The group entered the bank and immediately locked the doors behind them. The individual with the shotgun fired a shot into the air, which appeared to be a warning shot, and instructed everyone in the bank to get on the ground. The scene was chaotic and terrifying. The person with the rifle stood guard while the others approached the bank counter. The individual with the sword leapt over the counter and began hastily filling a bag with money. After filling the bag, the person with the sword jumped back over the counter, and the group promptly exited the bank. Their movements seemed planned and coordinated. They all wore black pants and black jackets, which made them look more intimidating. Once outside, they quickly got into a pink Ford van, where a fourth accomplice, wearing a KanyeWest mask, was waiting. The van then sped off towards the river, turning up Peter Avenue. The entire incident was shocking and occurred very rapidly.",1
2,b,"I was in the vicinity of the central business district, specifically on James Street, when I witnessed a disturbing crime. At about 4:20 pm, just before the local bank's closing time, I saw three individuals entering the bank in a very aggressive manner. Each of them was carrying a different weapon: a shotgun, a rifle, and a sword, respectively. They were also wearing unique masks: Bill Clinton, Captain Kirk, and Dolly Parton, which made them quite noticeable. As soon as they entered, they locked the doors, and the person with the shotgun discharged a shot into the air, presumably as a warning. This person ordered the patrons in the bank to lie down on the floor. Meanwhile, the individual with the rifle stood watch. The person with the sword quickly jumped over the counter and began to fill a bag with cash. After completing this task, they jumped back over the counter, and all three exited the bank rapidly. Their attire was uniformly dark, with black pants and jackets. This added a sinister aspect to their appearance. They then fled the scene in a pink Ford van, which was being driven by a fourth person wearing a Kanye West mask. The van drove off in the direction of the river before turning onto Peter Avenue. The event was extremely frightening and unfolded very quickly, leaving everyone in the area in a state of shock and disbelief.",1
3,c,"Okay, so, I was just chillin' near the bank, you know, minding my own business, when all of a sudden, this crazy scene unfolds. These three wild-looking characters bust into the bank. Now, I'm pretty sure the first dude was holding, like, a bazooka or something massive, but my mate says it was just a shotgun. He was rocking this Bill Clinton mask, which was so bizarre it was almost funny. Then there was this other person with what I swear looked like a laser gun, but I guess it must've been a rifle. They had this Captain Kirk mask on, but it looked more like Spock to me. The third one, I'll never forget, had this shiny, huge samurai sword and was wearing a Dolly Parton mask, but for a second, I thought it was Marilyn Monroe. Man, they were like something out of a movie, locking the doors with a dramatic flair. Shotgun dude fires off what seemed like a cannon shot, and yells something like, ""Everybody down, this is a stick-up!"" or something cheesy like that. The rifle guy was pacing like a caged animal, while sword person did this ninja jump over the counter. It was nuts! They filled this bag – and I'm telling you, it looked like it was bottomless – with cash. Then they all just bolted out of there, hopped into this absurdly bright pink van. It was like Barbie's dream van! And guess what? The driver had a Kanye mask on, but I swear for a moment I thought it was actually Kanye. They zoomed off towards the river, and I think they turned onto Peter Avenue, but who knows with all that adrenaline!",1
4,d,"So, there I was, just out for a stroll, when this scene from a Hollywood film plays out right in front of me. These three characters, right out of a comic book, storm into the bank. The leader, I'm sure, was carrying this gigantic gun, like something out of Terminator. He had a mask on, which I’m pretty sure was Bill Clinton, but it looked a bit like Elvis. The second person, oh my, they had this massive machine gun, could've been a rocket launcher for all I know, and a Captain Kirk mask – though it looked more like some alien from Star Trek. The third, no kidding, was wielding what I swear was a lightsaber, but I guess it must've been a sword, and had a Dolly Parton mask on – it was so lifelike, I thought it was her for a second! They slammed the doors shut and the leader fired a shot that shook the whole street. It was like a bomb went off! He was yelling something fierce, but I couldn't make it out. The one with the 'machine gun' was standing guard, looking all menacing, while the 'lightsaber' dude did this acrobatic flip over the counter. It was like watching an action movie! They stuffed this huge sack with money – it seemed to never fill up. Then, they ran out and jumped into this hot pink van. I mean, this van was so bright it hurt my eyes. And the driver, wearing a Kanye West mask, was the spitting image of Kanye himself! They tore off down the road, heading towards the river, then took a sharp turn onto Peter Avenue. The whole thing was surreal, like a scene straight out of a blockbuster movie!",1
5,e,"I was just coming out of the shop near the bank when this whole commotion started. First thing I saw was these three people rushing into the bank. One of them had a big gun, definitely a shotgun, but it looked super old, like something out of a Western movie. He had a mask on, and I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be Bill Clinton, but it looked more like George Bush to me. The second one, I think, had a rifle, but it looked really high-tech, almost like those guns in sci-fi movies. They were wearing a mask too, which I thought was Captain Kirk, but it could have been any Star Trek character, honestly. The third person, this was weird, they had a sword, like a medieval knight or something, and they were wearing a Dolly Parton mask, but it looked a bit off, like maybe it was actually Reba McEntire. They barged in, and the guy with the shotgun shouted something. I couldn't hear well, but it seemed like a typical robbery shout. Then the one with the sword did this clumsy hop over the counter – they almost tripped, I think. They started grabbing money, stuffing it into a bag. It all happened so fast. They ran out and jumped into this van. Now, this van was pink, but not a normal pink – more like a faded, dusty pink. And the driver, they had a Kanye West mask, but it looked too big for their face. They drove off real fast, heading towards the river. I think they turned onto Peter Avenue, but everything happened so quickly, it was hard to keep track.",1
6,f,"I was across the street from the bank, waiting for a friend, when I noticed something odd happening. Three people ran into the bank, and they were armed. The first one had a shotgun – it looked pretty standard to me. He was wearing a mask that I think was supposed to be Bill Clinton, but honestly, it looked more like some generic politician. The second person had what I thought was a hunting rifle. They were wearing a mask too, and I'm almost certain it was meant to be Captain Kirk, but it could've been any space-themed character. The third one was the most bizarre – they had a sword, like something out of a fantasy movie, and a Dolly Parton mask, though it seemed more like a generic blonde singer. They rushed in and locked the door. The one with the shotgun shouted something about getting down, but his voice was muffled by the mask. The sword-bearer clumsily jumped over the counter – it was hardly graceful – and started shoving money into a bag. It all seemed very chaotic. After they filled the bag, they ran out to a pink van. It was a really dull shade of pink, not bright at all. The driver was wearing a Kanye West mask, but it didn't really look like him, more like some random guy trying to be Kanye. They drove off in the direction of the river. I think they turned onto Peter Avenue, but honestly, I was so shocked by the whole scene, some details might be a bit fuzzy.",1
