faceman2k12,"with a tiny 2kw inverter you probably only have 2-3kw of panels, if they're 8 years old they might be only 200-250w panels so that tracks as 2.7kw installs were pretty common as the bottom of the barrel budget option around that time, these days you can get panels with practically double the peak output and inverters significantly more powerful to actually make use of that power more efficiently. 

I'd guess your neighbors are on 5kw inverters with 6.5kw or so of panels which was the most common fitout in 2016-18. I think it still is in many places with single phase power hookups.

your system is pretty small by modern standards, there is a chance that you have one degraded panel, which in a standard install will pull the entire array way down, like having a single dead cell in a battery.

Panels (number/size/type) determine how much is available to the inverter - inverter determines how much of that is usable to you or the grid

If the installer was anywhere near capable, then the panels and inverter are probably closely matched

There is a possibility that some of the cells in the panel are broken - they can burn out for lots of reasons (ask me how I know? I'm getting half the capacity of mine...) That is often visible damage

ApteronotusAlbifrons,"Others have covered your work questions so here's some general advice

Sunscreen - if we see somebody who looks like a cooked lobster, our first guess is that they are English

Swim between the flags - lots of people who think they are good swimmers die on our beaches - 99 people drowned in the surf in three months last summer. For Australia, for all of 2023, there were 281 drownings. For the UK, for all of 2023, there were only 236 drownings for a population that is two and a half times times larger. 

Spiders and snakes aren't waiting in every corner to get you - they would rather avoid you - and it makes sense for you to avoid them - so don't go sticking hands and feet in places you can't see (at least until you get better at figuring out where they are likely to be) Nobody has died from spider bite in Australia for decades, and very few die from snake bite - and nobody who is within half an hour of a hospital

Our really dangerous creatures are up north - most venomous snakes, crocodiles, irukandji/marine stingers (jellyfish), Queenslanders and Northern Territorians

Most of us will acknowledge each other, when passing, if it isn't crowded. A nod of the head or a Hey, Hello, or Hi... but nobody will really take offense if you just walk past. I haven't taken a taxi in years, but I would happily sit in the front seat and have conversations with the driver (something that I believe Londoners and New Yorkers would be astonished at) 

Language can be a bit more direct than many are used to - if you're being a dickhead, it's likely that somebody will tell you. Expect a lot more casual swearing than you are used to 

Internet - You should try to make sure your accommodation is NBN ready - preferably with FTTP. We have a mix of technologies for internet connections and some places are still coping with shit connections less than 25Mbps. You can check addresses on ISP pages or here  https://www.nbnco.com.au/  
Generally, FTTN is worst, then FTTC, then FTTP - you may also see HFC (Hybrid Fibre Coax) or FTTB (Fibre to the Building/Basement) which can both be comparable to FTTC and up to FTTP

Our houses are usually better at cooling than heating - you may need to wear extra layers inside in winter - but you will also probably feel the heat. The UK considers a heatwave to be three consecutive days over the threshold temperature (only 28 in/around London). Australia defines heatwaves differently - but you're looking at multiple days over 34 before anybody would call it a heat wave. You're about to get maybe 28 on Friday, but could be back down to the teens by next week - in summer. Sydney has been high teens this week and Melbourne was mid teens - in winter

There is a stereotype we formed here - a lot of people emigrated from the UK because it was cheap and they expected it to be wonderful - a small percentage of them were disappointed that they had to give up some things they liked and whinged about it. Less common nowadays - but it's part of our zeitgeist - so don't go saying ""X was better in London"" or ""you can't get good fish and chips like home"" or ""it's so HOT here"" or you'll be dismissed as a Whinging Pom",ldpbm7d,1721264893.0,2024-07-18T11:08:13,t3_1e5kktk,t3_1e5kktk,[],0

He reckoned that if it‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve seen it we probably won‚Äôt see it again and it‚Äôs most likely found its own way out. 

Still a bit on edge that it‚Äôs lurking somewhere in the shadows but on the plus side the puppy is a very happy girl as she has another night in the bed with me.

Definitely keep the pup off the floor at the very least. It‚Äôs highly unlikely it‚Äôll make its way into your room if you‚Äôve blocked under the door & that‚Äôs the only entry point. Nor do they generally climb into things like beds; they‚Äôre much more scared of you than you are of them as hard as that may be to believe right at the minute.

Either way, I‚Äôd be wearing closed toe shoes and long pants around for a while & keeping the dog close by. If it does reappear then definitely call in a snake catcher.

Jack-Tar-Says,"Until recently I worked in a hospital in northern regional Australia. During summer, we‚Äôd get about 5 - 6 venomous snake bites per week (on average). People don‚Äôt realise how many people get bitten because it‚Äôs only in the news when people die. Of those 5 - 6, about 80% were browns but there are Red Belly Blacks and Eastern Taipans too, however Browns dominate everything. 

And of those people bitten, just about every one of them wasn‚Äôt interacting with the snake, they were random. Moving farm equipment, timber, building material, heck one lady was just working in her garden right outside her door. You should never ‚Äúattack‚Äù the snake, but if you have to interact with it (and by that I mean you have zero chance of getting a trained snake catcher), then do it as far as arms length you can. Get the doors open, try to gently encourage to make an exit. Sometimes though people choose another course of action. Last year I was on a rural property 250km‚Äôs from the nearest town (and by town I mean it had a pop of more than 100 people), working with a guy when his wife called him up to say there was a brown outside the kitchen door. He just drove straight back to the house, grabbed his shot gun and that was the end of the snake. 

Do I condone that? Probably not. Do I understand it? Yes I do. Because if you‚Äôre bitten it‚Äôs going to be 2 - 3 hours before you can get your backside into a hospital bed. And that‚Äôs counting on the roads being open (its mainly red dirt country).",l2m87gu,1714865942.0,2024-05-05T09:39:02,t3_1ck0b37,t1_l2m5sc0,[],0

None,"I think with 7 cats pet insurance is going to be more than what it's worth, especially if any of yours are already over 8 years old. There are some vetpay options nowadays though (kinda like after pay or specifically a small loan for vet bills), but be careful on how much can be approved $ .

Might I recommend opening a savings account and putting some $$ away every pay that can go directly to their vet care? That way, if something DOES comes up you're not completely blindsided. 

I was having trouble finding pet insurance to cover my only senior cat, even though she hasn't had any issues her entire life up until last year(she needed a bladder stone surgically removed) and it was just not going to be worth it for me personally cost wise, so I started doing what I said above ^, and now have enough to cover any future vet visits and/or surgeries. My mum lent me the money at the time to pay for the surgery which kinda kicked my ass into putting money away.

When I was looking into insurance I was only going to get covered for accidents/illnesses for about $30 fortnight (Through RSPCA insurance, but most that I looked at were like this - especially because she then had a pre-existing condition once the stone was discovered). 

I would recommend pet insurance if you can afford to though, especially if they're under 9 years old ATM (over 9 and you'll have extremely limited options like I did), but understandably with the amount of cats thats almost $150 a fortnight for the same policy I mentioned earlier (I could be wrong, my maths is terrible but there was a 5-10% on each additional pet). Otherwise like I suggested, pop some money into an interest accumulating savings account and do touch it unless something comes up.

Best of luck! üêæ

Other_Mammoth5687,"Regarding the builder.  It is 12 months so far since I first made contact, lol.  I am so desperate to get it all finished.  Although I have lived in this same street since 1972, and have now moved back into my original family home (which is on the other side of the street of my home that I had to sell), there are only 2 neighbours remaining since I grew up here as a kid.  The rest are not just new to the street, but new to the area and seem to have a general dislike for cats.

Awww your poor klutz.  I hope they are doing okay now!  I was lucky with Boof‚Äôs Christmas stay at the vet.  The actual vet/owner attended the surgery each day and even texted me to say she had taken him down some turkey, lol.  I don‚Äôt remember the whole visit costing more than this tail amputation, and admittedly it was a few years ago now, but the charges are now seemingly a lot more.

Interestingly, my first cat, that my parents got when I was a baby, lived to 17 and was an outdoor cat.  I understand the thoughts on cat ownership as they are now, but my past cat ownership was not like that, and my cats have always had long lives.  The one who died the youngest ended up with a genetic issue.  He wasn‚Äôt a pedigree by any means, but his genes had pedigree in them somewhere (as the vet explained) which made him susceptible.

Weirdly enough, the tail injury on this cat, and the lower back injury creating the last vet visit were both since we moved and both happened indoors.  Until my renovations are done, I have a lot of things stored and stacked, like boxes and large and small furniture items.  It seems that on both occasions, their own indoor home has done them injury when something has fallen on them while they climb, in, on and over everything.  They miss their tree climbing and exploring under bushes etc.  They also are now not so friendly with each other and have struggled to find their own favourite spaces.

The article mentions smaller fangs meaning less noticible puncture wounds, lack off immediate symptoms before quickly deteriorating, they are hard to identify (not all brown) and the anti venom does not work well against younger snakes.

I'd add that browns are present in many suburban areas, and have adapted relatively well to that life. So there are more run ins with humans.

The idea that a brown snake, or any snake in Australia for that matter, would chase a human or act specifically aggressive towards a human is straight up wrong. They are defensive, if cornered or heavily threatened (eg attempted handling), then they will strike as a matter of self defence.

Brown snakes kill a person on average once every 18 months.

And about 550 people are admitted to hospital with snakebite every year. Of which 35 die.

[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/23/more-than-half-australian-snake-bite-deaths-since-2000-occurred-at-victims-home](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/23/more-than-half-australian-snake-bite-deaths-since-2000-occurred-at-victims-home)

The rough-scaled snake, also known as Tropidechis carinatus, is a venomous snake native to Australia. Here are some of its characteristics:

Appearance: As the name suggests, it has rough scales, which are keeled (ridged), giving it a rough texture. It has a slender body and a distinct, triangular-shaped head.

Size: Adults typically range from 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet) in length, although some individuals can grow larger.

Coloration: They often have a dark brown or black coloration, sometimes with lighter bands or markings along the body.

Venom: The rough-scaled snake possesses potent venom, primarily neurotoxic, which can cause paralysis and respiratory failure in prey or humans if bitten. It is considered dangerous to humans.

Habitat: It inhabits various habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and coastal areas, primarily in eastern and southeastern Australia.

Behavior: Rough-scaled snakes are nocturnal hunters, preying on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They are generally shy and elusive, preferring to retreat rather than confront threats.

Reproduction: They are oviparous, laying eggs in clutches typically during the warmer months. The female guards the eggs until they hatch.

Conservation status: The rough-scaled snake is not listed as endangered, but habitat destruction and persecution by humans pose threats to its populations in some areas.

Overall, the rough-scaled snake is a fascinating yet potentially dangerous species found in certain regions of Australia.",kw3y4qb,1711143404.0,2024-03-23T07:36:44,t3_1bkrsbe,t1_kw3xlsp,"['kw41hh6', 'kw6aacd']",2

Brown snake bite can kill you in half an hour. So you are racing against time once you are bitten.

During that time the venom couldn‚Äôt make it to any major organs, and eventually the venom was broken down by the immune system and the person survived.

For any snake bite - pressure immobilisation bandage applied to the bitten limb and avoid movement, call an ambulance. For any large, dark spider bite it‚Äôs the same (assume it‚Äôs a funnel web). Box jellyfish gets vinegar and urgent ambulance. Hot water for stonefish. Like there‚Äôs lots of different things to do for various creatures‚Ä¶ but most of them boil down to ‚Äúcall an ambulance and try not to move too much‚Äù and hope you‚Äôre not alone. 

The dangers of venomous creatures are often overstated. We do have some dangerous creatures - some of which you have a fair chance of encountering. The risk of being bitten unless you‚Äôre cornering or handling them is fairly low. The risk of death with proper treatment is extremely low.

bigbowlowrong,"When I was a kid - like 8 to 10 years old - I was *obsessed* with reptiles. Read everything I could about snakes and lizards. Unfortunately I lived in inner suburban Melbourne and the pickings were rather slim for reptiles - just a few garden skinks here and there in spring and summer and maybe a marbled gecko or two.

Anyway, one summer my family went to Merimbula on the NSW south coast, and that area had way more reptile biodiversity. I spent the whole holiday roaming around catching blue tongues, various other skinks, and water dragons and the like. Also frogs and scorpions and stuff, but reptiles were my main focus.

So, one time I was walking along a bush track near a beach by myself on one of my daily reptile hunts, and this 6 foot long snake suddenly started slinking along the trail directly in front of me. It was a [light brown colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_brown_snake) (!!!). I was so incredibly thrilled to see a REAL SNAKE that my brain just completely turned off and I jogged up to it and touched its tail - I don‚Äôt recall trying to grab it, just touch it. It quickly slithered off into the bush.

You are extremely unlikely to get bitten unless you don't leave them alone.

No. They're all Red Bellied Black Snakes. But it's not uncommon for them to have a yellow belly, or even blueish or pink. The species is still called Red even if they're yellow, but you can absolutely find snakes that are visually a ""yellow bellied black snake""; they are Red.

Gullible-Aide4331,"Yeah, You've gotta work hard to get bitten though, They are generally pretty reluctant to bite and have small fangs to the rear of their mouth, so they need to bite and ""chew"" a bit to properly envenomate. Unlikely they would get through a pair of trousers. 

Having said that they are pretty unpleasant to be bitten by, but people were known to survive a bite without antivenom  back in the day, by lying real still and not moving. Basically you can cop a bit of venom, as long as the concentration remains low around your critical organs. Venom gets pumped around your body by the lymphatic system which itself driven my musculoskeletal movement. So by staying still it means the venom slowly circulates around the body preventing a high concentration around critical organs which can kill you. 

There's a book about Eric Worrell (started the gosford reptile park) and in it they talk about a bunch of old school snake handlers getting bit by red bellies and surviving that way.

 They often live in similar environments to Death Adders, without competing for resources so they often coexist without a problem. Death Adders can often have bands similar to some Tigers. That's the only reason I can think of why they would be lumped under the same name. 
Whilst Red Belly Snakes will eat Brown or other snakes and for some reason are immune to other snakes venom, they don't really eat enough to have any noticeable difference to a brown snake population.

The radius is 2.75m so the circumference is 2œÄr=~17.28m

The velocity is distance over time -> 17.28 metres in 2 seconds -> 17.28/2 =~ 8.64 metres per (one) second.

The centripetal acceleration, which is the acceleration an object experiences when travelling on a circular path at a uniform speed, is velocity squared over radius (some trickier maths involved in explaining why this is).

So 8.64*8.64/2.75 is roughly 27.14 metres per second per second

1G is about 9.8 metres per second per second so 27.14/9.8 =~ 2.77G",kofd25m,1706790831.0,2024-02-01T22:33:51,t3_1ag6z1e,t1_koewh06,"['kofde6n', 'kohaqt6', 'kok1mfu', 'kojewqs', 'kofs4rr', 'koip3zn', 'koiv0qj', 'kojkycm', 'kojpwbz', 'kok2b0d', 'koknirw', 'kopvxb8', 'koq9d3h', 'kot8fp1', 'kovqk4c', 'kp4xn6q', 'koiscnv', 'kok8xlv', 'koipf70', 'kokaaa9', 'koigkr5', 'koiptp1', 'kojgzb4', 'kojqf20', 'kokuxse', 'kok8d4d', 'kokrzu0', 'kokgu7c', 'kop5j0z', 'koq778i', 'kokigmo', 'kojhf2g', 'kojqvvh', 'kokiwr6', 'kov0e96', 'koqigjn', 'kou0bqi', 'komnjle', 'kojjtop', 'koyjhyi', 'koxw4z5', 'kovps8f', 'koyl79s']",43

Needmoresnakes,"Yeah im gonna agree. Obviously scary as hell and most people aren't going to be thinking super clear.

Edit to add: guys I am not admonishing a little girl for trying to save her pet. She's a panicked child. This is a comment about snake physiology.

If this happens to you and you're blessed with a clear head at the time, I reccomend:

1. Your main concern with a pet is going to be the bite+hold+wrap. Sometimes they do a ""tag bite"" and let go immediately which isn't fun but also isn't a big issue if it's not venemous.

2. Constrictors kill their prey by apoxic shock before eating it so the first thing you need to do is unwrap it. Don't worry about the mouth until you've uncoiled it from whatever it's coiled on.

3. More often than not it will let go itself at this point. They're vulnerable when eating so if you're up in it's face it knows it can't have this meal right now. If it's really determined then you can splash some water in it's face or if you have like metho or hand sanny or even some normal drinking spirits handy just put some on your hand and wave it near the snakes nose. They hate that and will retreat.

4. If it's really really really determined (or probably just scared and latching in panic) then you can use something like a credit card. Slowly and gently work it between the teeth and whatever it's biting. Their teeth curve inwards so if you pull it'll tear the skin up but you can sort of pry them off. Very unlikely this would be needed but it's an option.

Finally, if you think your pet has been bitten by a snake and you don't know what kind, get it to a vet. Even if it seems fine. Dogs especially are known for seeming totally ok so you think they didn't get bitten then they rapidly decline within the next 24hrs or so at which point it's too late.",koi8ujx,1706828294.0,2024-02-02T08:58:14,t3_1ag6z1e,t1_kofapcf,"['koij9ds', 'koj57b7', 'kovmj9l', 'koisyey', 'koj843l', 'koite7f', 'koiy4bl']",7

KelpieoftheLakes,"12‚Ä¶ is old enough to be smarter than this, IMO. In a moment of panic like that, wouldn‚Äôt the logical, instinctual response be to grab at the snake‚Äôs head, and try to get the guinea pig OUT? Constricting snakes don‚Äôt bite down to kill their prey, like a cat would. Their teeth may look gnarly, but they basically exist to serve as Velcro: they‚Äôre just for holding on to prey. Whereas swinging a small, fragile animal dangling from a predator‚Äôs mouth in circles is a much faster, more efficient way to cause it fatal injuries.

I have strong suspicions that this was a situation they set up, or at least took advantage of, in the hopes of going viral. And would you look at that? It worked. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",kr5q1xe,1708361586.0,2024-02-20T02:53:06,t3_1ag6z1e,t1_koikgsj,[],0

roundhouse51,"Don't just wave it by the snake's nose, fully put in on it's face and mouth. Snake's eyes are covered by a spectacle and won't be harmed by alcohol. It'll get in their nose and mouth, which won't be permanently harmed either. 

Also, if you have immediate access to hand sanitiser etc., it's much faster to have the snake unlatch than to manually uncoil them (which also makes them want to coil tighter and bite harder. ask me how I know). Another option for unlatching is dunking them underwater. The snake will choose breathing over eating, and will do so quickly enough so that it will be unharmed. 

If you or your pet is put in grave danger by a constrictor, and you don't have time for these harmless methods, just hit the snake really hard. If it's not constricting any vital areas, though, please take the time to preserve the snake's life.

jimb2,"G as in the acceleration due to gravity, specifically, near the Earth's surface.  

It's normally written as small g to distinguish from big G the universal gravitational constant, but you can get this from the context if you know the physics.  Small g can be calculated from big G with the mass and size of the Earth.

If there is no resistance or other forces an object gains speed at a rate of 9.8 metres per second each second.  So it's going 9.8 m/s after one second, 19.6 m/s after 2 seconds, 29.4 after 3 etc.   Because we are familiar with g, it is used as a handy unit for acceleration, eg, a pilot or astronaut experienced 3 g at some point in a flight.  

In classical physics we say that gravity is a force that pulls on objects of equal the g times the mass.  In general relativity it more like space-time is curving towards the centre of the Earth, so objects just slide down that slope if nothing is stopping them.

MrDrSirLord," I was taught to grab snakes by the tail and immediately whip/spin them similar to this and either fling them far away  if you don't want to hurt them too much, or smash their heads into something to kill them.

If you're unarmed in a situation backing off isn't an option spinning them is the safest option to not get bitten.

If you try and grab near their head it requires a lot more speed and understanding of the snakes reactions to accomplish safety.

But don't grab the tail if you aren't going to spin it, as it can and likely will turn around and bite you if you aren't controlling its head.

A kid barefoot stomping on a snake would have been one of the worst options to choose, they very likely wouldn't have the courage to pin it probably or strength to kill it and would just make it more aggressive towards them.

The best option is if possible, just don't go near them, most snakes are pretty docile and just passing through if you don't disturb them. Although sometimes they get stuck or lost, or hungry, and letting them be is unfortunately not an option.",koitl2j,1706836144.0,2024-02-02T11:09:04,t3_1ag6z1e,t1_koika8l,['koixy87'],1

In case anyone has forgot, the general advice when encountering a snake is to stand still, make no sudden movements and to back/move away making sure not to corner the snake. What the child did was corner it, and then pick it up, and proceed to hold it whilst spinning around.

Luckily this was a python, and maybe this particular child was able to instantaneously identify it as that. I can assure you though that the majority of children do not know how to identify snakes.

Snap111,"It is because the angle of approach back down  to the ground becomes sharper at the end of the parabola. 1m of height difference is not much however if you imagine firing a cannon off a bridge or something much higher, the angle of the ball returning to earth towards the end of the flight path is going to be steep and towards 90 degrees which means less distance gained at the end of the flight path. For max distance that steep angle is ""bad"". To reduce that or have that steepness  occur for less of the flight path, you need to fire that cannon at a lower angle to flatten the end of the parabola and get a greater distance.

Have a play around in here. Should be self explanatory after adjusting height and a few angles of release. There is a point where lowering the angle too far will be counterproductive and result in less distance, I have no idea the kind of equation you would need to use to find the sweet spot for a particular height of release though.

If that's all too convoluted

I now basically can see that while 45 is an ideal angle for shooting on flat ground, shooting from an elevated position gives additional fall distance and this fall time, meaning less than 45 an angle needed to optimally overcome gravity and allow greatest horizontal travel time",koj17v9,1706839183.0,2024-02-02T11:59:43,t3_1ag6z1e,t1_kohrtc0,"['koj76ff', 'kojxm7p']",2

Crs_s,"> LifeFlight's chief medical officer Dr Allan MacKilllop praised the woman's family for providing excellent first aid. 

> ""They kept the patient very still, they kept the limb still and they used a snake bandage to firmly encircle the limb to prevent movement of the venom towards the centre of the body,"" Dr MacKillop said. 

> ""They also called for the ambulance quickly, sought help, kept her calm and reassured her until the ambulance arrived. So they did everything they were supposed to do.""

If you live in rural areas or any area prone to venomous snakes knowing what to do when one bites could be the difference between life and death. Good on them for staying so calm and applying first aid so diligently.

untamedeuphoria,"I used to work as an oyster farmer.

There's this fish that is related to the lionfish and even closer to the stonefish, called the eastern fortescue. It's venom gives you all the pain and a lot of the loss of motor control in the effect limb as the stonefish. But unlike the stonefish or lionfish it won't kill you. But you do get 8-12 hours resisting the urge to cut your forarm (or whatever section hit) off because you are utterly convinced it would hurt less.

As an oyster farmer we see these guys tangled in the seaweed attached to the base of the grow trays, and caught in the grow bags. You'd get stung between once a week to once a month. So, as a result you could leave work to have a 'happy moment' while recovering from them. Fortunately, you could develop a resistent to the effects of the venom. So after about a year, it was like having a really bad cramp for an hour or so then aches for the rest of the day.

A collegue of mine really fucked with them though. She was piling them up at the end of the boat where there was a shelf at the front to sit and work from. These boats at flat bottomed lake skimmers that are as a result quite stable in the water, but can be fucked with by rolling waves. Well she was at the front and counting how many trays were on each rack to make sure nothing came loose over the previous few days as the boat was moving. That's when someone raced by at speed on their fishing boat. When the waves hit, she lost her balance and fell with her hand pinned under her on the pile of dead fortescue carcusses. The venom survives the death of the animal.. so she thinks she got hit with about a dozen. That one landed her in hospital despite her resistence. The boss ended up driving her... I think.... it was like 10 years ago..",kh5m6s1,1704856590.0,2024-01-10T13:16:30,t3_192ta6q,t1_kh4z0e4,"['kh5pr85', 'kh7qz79', 'kh6iwj5']",3

Domestic cats are considered one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide, causing impacts from predation, disease transmission, hybridisation (with native wildcats, in Europe and Africa), and competition.
Globally, cats are considered to have contributed to the extinction of at least two reptile, 40 bird and 21 mammal species ‚Äì over one quarter (26%) of the total extinctions of these groups since the year 1600.
Currently, cats are contributing to the imperilment of at least 360 threatened reptile, bird and mammal species worldwide, about half of which are species restricted to islands.
In Australia, at least 34 mammal species have become extinct since European settlement ‚Äì a rate of mammal extinctions far greater than anywhere else in the world. Cats have been primary contributors to over two-thirds of these extinctions.
Examples include native marsupials like two species of pig-footed¬†bandicoots, the lesser bilby, the Nullarbor dwarf bettong, the desert rat-kangaroo and the broad-faced potaroo; and native rodents including at least four species of hopping-mice, two species of rabbit-rat, and the lesser stick-nest rat.
Cats have also been primary agents in the extinction of some Australian birds that were restricted to islands, such¬†as the Macquarie Island parakeet and Macquarie Island buff-banded rail.
Ôøº

Evidence of the impact of cats

There is extensive evidence of the impact of cats on Australian native species.
Many historical mammal extinctions corresponded to the spatial and temporal spread of cats across¬†the continent.
Many native species (for example, the greater stick-nest rat and banded hare-wallaby) now persist only in areas that have remained cat-free (such as some islands, and more recently, fenced exclosures), and are unable to persist if cats are present.
There are also examples where species disappeared from islands after cats were introduced, but after the cats were eradicated, the same native mammal species have been successfully reintroduced to the islands (such as the western barred bandicoot and Shark Bay mouse to Faure Island in Shark Bay).
There have been many reintroduction attempts for threatened mammals¬†on the mainland, and a key factor that determines whether an attempt is successful is whether cats are present or not.
Species that have become extinct, or whose populations have been most severely reduced, are (or were) mostly of the favoured prey size for cats, live (or lived) on the ground (rather than in trees), and that live (or lived) in areas of sparser vegetation (where it is harder to escape predators).

Ôøº

Many studies of the biology of Australian wildlife species have documented high rates of mortality from cats.
Many studies of the diet of cats have shown that they take large numbers of many wildlife species, including highly threatened birds, mammals and reptiles.
The historic and ongoing impacts of cats on Australian wildlife are far more severe than for wildlife on any other continent. This is probably because Australian animals have evolved without cat-like predators, many Australian animals have low rates of reproduction so their viability is readily compromised¬†by an efficient predator (especially one with much higher reproductive rates), and because cats are so pervasive and such adaptable hunters.

How many Australian animals do cats kill?

How estimates are calculated

We have estimated the toll of cats on native (and introduced) animal species by: (i) collating all the local and regional cat diet studies carried out in Australia (about 100 studies,¬†which examined about 10,000 cat diet samples, and with studies collected across a wide range of Australian environments); (ii) modelling and extrapolating from these to derive¬†a spatial layer of the variation in¬†numbers (and types) of animals killed per cat; and (iii) multiplying this by the (spatially variable) number of feral cats in Australia. From these analyses, we can determine the numbers¬†of different types of animals killed by cats in different parts of Australia, and then sum these to derive national tallies.
This approach relies on some assumptions: for example, that the fraction of carrion (i.e. pre-killed animals) in the cat diet is small (which is reasonable, as cats much prefer¬†to eat freshly-killed prey); and also that the numbers of animals killed by feral cats but not eaten is also¬†small. Information on the diets of pet cats, and feral cats living in towns, is patchier than for feral cats in the bush.

Findings

Overall, feral cats in Australia eat about 2 billion reptiles, birds, frogs and mammals each year, and over a billion invertebrates. Mammals are the most commonly eaten of these prey items, for all types of cat (pets¬†and ferals), with more than one billion mammals killed by cats in Australia every year. Pet cats that roam and hunt kill an additional 390 million mammals, birds and reptiles annually.
Most of the animals killed are native species. The percentage of native animals in the diet depends on whether the cat lives in the bush or in towns, and the type of animal prey.
For example, nearly all of the reptiles and birds killed by feral cats in the bush are native species, whilst¬†most mammals killed by pet cats in towns are introduced species.
This annual toll translates to 1.9 million reptiles, 1.2 million birds, 3.2 million mammals, 3 million invertebrates¬†and at least 0.25 million frogs killed every day in Australia by cats.


#(Mammals in this case includes rabbits, bandicoots, wallabie joey's, bilbys, quolls, possoms, bats, squirrels, bush/hopping mice(endangered), rats and mice ) 

#Native long tailed hopping mice, desert bandi coot and crescent tail wallabies are extinct partly due to cats!

Banded hair wallabies only live where cats have been banned and bated and shot! 



>Cats also kill introduced birds and mammals, especially rabbits and house mice (in southern Australia), however cats rarely control populations of these introduced pests. High densities of rabbits and introduced rodents also allow cats to reach high densities,¬†which means that even if those cats take only a small proportion of native animal species in their diet, the toll on native species will still be high.

>There are records of cats eating almost half of all Australian bird species, including 71 species listed as threatened at national or global

The toll of birds is greatest on islands, and in arid areas of

For birds, the likelihood of being killed by a cat is highest if it lives on an island, if it is in the size range 60-300g, and if it nests and/or forages on the ground

#This includes native fairy penguins! WHO LIVE ON LAND!

Interestineverythang,"Why does this make me want to go to the pokies?

The odds are stacked against you, are you gonna go all in next time and buy 5 packs chasing the justice and excitement of snake majority bag... 

OR..

Go slow and steady and get a pack another 5 times in a controlled experimental decision to try to get some rational insight into Allen's cheeky game of potentially 
a) a very considered social- science-based approach to the selection in the bagging stage of the manufacturing process or 
b) simply an unfortunate outlier in a game of complete random/ chance- based bagging) 

Either way, I'm suddenly keen for that self-defeating thing I do often.. that is, when it's not.

no idea how they went out of business. Seems insane to me.

Why would you shut down a pure profit machine? 
Must have been something dodgy going on behind the scenes I reckon.

*edit* I looked it up and there are so many different reasons given for why they are no longer being sold. 

They have said they are banned in Australia due to titanium dioxide being used as a colouring,
That coles and woollies stopped selling them because sales were poor, that cost was too high, and that there were supply chain issues over the last couple of years like many other businesses. There doesn't seem to be any one clear reason.... which I find awfully suspicious tbh. You would think them being made illegal in aus would be the end of it but there were so many other excuses, plus surely thst one colouring wouldn't apply to every single one of their products...

Not dangerous, looks a bit too small in the photo to be predating any cats/dogs either (could be wrong though, hard to pick the scale from a photo). That pile of rubbish looks like a dream for a snake though, including elapids - you can often find snakes under similar things if you're looking for them, so be careful. If it's on your land, I'd recommend clearing it to avoid something more dangerous calling it home.

I'll also go against the general consensus here - if it is on your land and you're not worried about it, I wouldn't bother getting it relocated. Snakes have a very high mortality rate when relocated unless the relocater is very thoughtful about where they release.

You have been bitten by the snake and ""wait and see"".

You then deteriorate and require more intensive medical treatment - airlifted to tertiary hospital, extended ICU stay and then even after all that you may be really worse off or possibly die!

Versus having some anti venom and monitoring for 12-24 hours.

Our venomous snakes are haemo-neurotoxic so they are bad news.  Depending on the state they will do a VDK (venom detection kit) of the bite site - particularly if there are multiple well known venomous snakes locally as well as bloods - specifically coagulation profiles to ascertain whether VICC (venom induced consumptive coagulopathy) is occurring and hence envenomation.   Pressure bandage stays on until after the first set of bloods +/- a VDK.  If you need antivenom you will get that prior to PBI removal. Then it is wait and repeat bloods.  

You aren‚Äôt wasting the ED‚Äôs time, better to be sure you weren‚Äôt envenomed then risk it.

stethamascope,"I have worked across a few different 'rural' A&E's in Australia. 

Let me tell you, this is super common. 

&#x200B;

I had my first one of the season \~ 6 weeks ago. Pretty routine one every few days now. 

&#x200B;

You should always come in. You pay your taxes, or you don't, but you should still come in. It's an easy problem for us as health care professionals to manage, you just need to present to a hospital that has on-site 24/h pathology. 

&#x200B;

Most snake bites cause death either through:

1. venom induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC). Body freaks the fuck out and uses all of its clotting factors, leading to easy bleeding and organ dysfunction from activated clotting factors blocking off / disrupting blood flow / affecting the kidneys
2. Cardiovascular collapse. Most common with the brown. When envenomated directly into an artery or vein. Causes circulatory collapse
3. Neurotoxin. Causes a descending paralysis. So first your cranial nerves (think facial droop, eyes in weird directions) go, and then progressively your breathing, you die, snake eats you. 

&#x200B;

You need to go to hospital. 

&#x200B;

I have seen first hand a well built athletic person who walked in and said ""it's probably nothing"" progress to having fulminant neurotoxicity in the span of \~3 hours. 

Almost all ED's and A&E's follow the same protocol which calls for 12 hourly bloods, which then dictate further management. In most cases if only minor abnormalities are present (i.e. dropping of platelets with normal Hb and renal function) we discuss with poisons / tox who give us some further advice, but generally conseravative management. 

&#x200B;

I have only had to use antivenom once, and that was a case of neurotoxin. Antivenom use raises many many problems (mainly high risk of anaphylaxis and a serum sickness ... we generally had an adrenaline infusion ready to go if we are starting antivenom). 

&#x200B;

Anways.... I find snake bites fascinating. It's crazy and gruesome how they've evolved to kill larger animals. Literally make the prey's heart stop, muscles stop working, or bleed from every orifice until they haemorrhage to death.

&#x200B;

Always to present to ED. We don't care. It's an easy case for us (in most cases!)

Clearly because your first choice of action after a potential snake bite was to panic and go for a 100m jog. Good way to get the blood and any possible venom pumping.

The fact that the group ""investigated"" the aggressive snake suggests a lack of ""snake protocol"" amongst everyone present since that's a good way to get another person bit by a snake that's already been riled up.

So in my opinion the only smart thing you did (albeit not as promptly as you should have) was going to the hospital. The very thing you're so guilty about.

I'd question the value of an ""outdoor education industry"" that can't formulate a proper response to a snake bite and allows an employee into the field without the most basic knowledge of what to do in that situation.

dmk_aus,"It is the medical professionals job to assess what care, treatment, testing and time is needed - as long as you are open and honest with them - you are not responsible for any time or money ""wasted"". 


A test that they do, that comes back negative is a good thing. They did what was appropriate based on their training, education and experience. Sometimes snakes dry bite, sometimes a stick stabs you while you run from a snake, sometimes you die (super rare, normally only once per person) and sometimes medical treatment saves someone.


This applies to all medical concerns, blood in stool, bleeding nose that won't stop, persistent headache, boner that lasts too long, snake bite or possum scratch (The last one of these is the only one that I've taken to a doctor, I needed a tetanus shot). You tell them your concerns, you openly and honestly answer their questions and tell them anything you think is relevant. They choose what is needed (sometimes you need a 2nd or 3rd medical opinion - not recommended for snake bites, a bit time sensitive - but spinal surgery or dismissed concerns about period pain are almost always worth 2nd opinions). 


The only way you can waste medical resources is if you lie, leave it too long to go so they need to do even more to recover (though sometimes this happens for many reasons no point feeling guilty just go), ignore simple preventative measures (no garters, no vaccines), or injured yourself through deliberate endangerment (I assume you weren't trying to kiss the Browny?)

Basically, overall, relax. You think a snake bit you, you tell a Dr/Nurse what you saw, the best you can hope for is ""nah you ain't bit/dry bite"".

I had a call where a lady thought she had been bitten, turned out to be punctures from the rose bush she was pruning. No one involved thought it was a waste of resources. And this one was rural so involved inter agency response. (Way more than yours would have). Don't fuck with snake bites. 

30min response time is very good (depending on certain variables), it could take a lot longer. 

You did the right thing by calling. I would say you probably ""should"" have called sooner.

splodgenessabounds,"Firstly, I'm glad to hear you're recovering.

Secondly, no matter who you are or where you're from, if you're going bush get some proper first aid training behind you appropriate to going off-piste in Australia. St. Johns Ambulance used to do a Remote First Aid course, it was extensive and inexpensive. Join a volunteer wildlife rescue organisation and you can sign up for a reptile handling course that teaches you both first aid and how to be around (and handle) snakes, elapids or otherwise. This is especially important for anyone leading a group, clients or not.

I'm glad (and I'm sure you are too) you were wearing gaiters: they're not perfect but better than nothing (and if you survive a snake bite for wearing them, who cares what you look like). 

Lastly, as many others have said, the very last thing you should do is a 100m dash in record time with the snake wrapped around you. By all means get yourself away from the snake: after that, be as still as you can, stop the flow of lymph on the affected limb, get someone to dial 000. On your own? Do the same - if you're going bush seriously, carry the first aid kit and a personal EPIRB.

All that said, spring is breeding season for many a genus, and snakes are no exception. Even the more placid elapids (red-bellied black) can get quite snotty at this time of the year.",k8wp081,1699780003.0,2023-11-12T19:06:43,t3_17rnwo8,t3_17rnwo8,[],0

Jack-Tar-Says,"Long time hospital worker here - don‚Äôt worry about the resources and take the view that the bite struck, always. 

And bites are very common. In the regional hospitals I was in (200+ bed), we‚Äôd average two or three per week this time of year. 

So don‚Äôt dismiss it because here‚Äôs an example of dismissing when you shouldn‚Äôt have. 

Groundsmen at the hospital got a call that there was a brown snake at the back door of a clinical building. Two guys go down and as they approach it, it goes to slither under the door and enter the building. So Groundsman one reaches down and grabs it by the tail, with the snake flicking around and striking him on the thumb. He lets go, the snake goes in the other direction (not inside) and he looks at his thumb and can see a bite. He thinks, ‚ÄúShit, shouldn‚Äôt have done that so I‚Äôll just ignore it.‚Äù Tells groundsman two to not say anything and goes and washes his thumb and hands with soap.

They then get a call to go with a third worker and retrieve a hospital bed that had been on loan to a palliative patient who has died at home, and to load up and bring the bed back for a clean up and next loan out. So all three of them head off and drive 20 minutes away, get the bed out of the house and then are loading it onto the flat bed of the light vehicle they‚Äôre in. 

At that point, Groundsman one goes ‚ÄúHelp boys, I‚Äôm going down‚Äù, with groundsman two spilling the beans to the third bloke on what took place 30 minutes previously. They then literally throw him into the vehicle and rocket themselves to the ED at the hospital. He gets seen straight away, they swab the thumb and it comes up positive with venom present, and he‚Äôs moved to ICU, where he stays for 3 days, then ward for another 3 and then discharge. So outcome was he lost kidney capacity due to the venom and was off work for a month.

Btw for all confirmed strikes, we always put the patient in the ICU, so they can be monitored one on one.

gpolk,"I'm an Australian doctor. I used to work in Toxicology and have done rural work (doing more rural next year). So I've seen my share of bites.

I've admitted someone to hospital for monitoring who I'm pretty sure actually just tripped on a broom and scratched themselves on seeing a possible venomous snake that could have just been a lizard. You just don't fuck around with potentially deadly snakes.

We monitor, do repeat bloods looking for signs of envenomation. Give antivenom if needed. Don't if not as bad reactions can occur from the antivenom. Adult snakes will sometimes do dry bites as like a warning strike.

You should absolutely 100% go straight to hospital if you think you may have been bitten. Even if you aren't actually sure. Better safe than sorry. Don't feel bad. Welcome to Australia. What an introduction you've had.

Waiting to see if you feel sick would be a really terrible decision. We aren't basing treatment off if you feel sick, it's the blood tests. We look at your blood counts and chemistry but most importantly, your blood clotting tests. There's certain changes with that which will tell us if you've been envenomated and need treatment. You can't run your coags at home, so go to hospital.",k8kpm1g,1699573767.0,2023-11-10T09:49:27,t3_17rnwo8,t3_17rnwo8,[],0

Everything you did was correct. It looks like the snake got you a couple of times, and your symptoms suggest it definitely tried to envenomate you, but your gaiters prevented it from getting a proper grip. waiting and seeing would have put you squarely in the ‚Äòim fucked‚Äô territory. Brown snakes kill you by coagulating your blood, so the docs now need to make sure that those changes in your clotting factors aren‚Äôt going to put you at risk of things like stroke or heart attacks.

Nervardia,"100% go to the hospital for any form of wild snake bite, even if it looks like a carpet.

Woma pythons and tiger snakes look very similar to the untrained eye, and brown snakes come in a lot of different colours and hatchlings can look like an adult Children's python.

The good news is, venom is extremely expensive for a snake to produce, and more often than not, they don't envenomate. They need venom for hunting and digestion. I think they did studies and found something like 70% of venomous snake bites were dry.

Here's how I describe the thought process of venomous snakes when they come into contact with humans.

Imagine you're at home and someone comes into your house. You have three weapons. One is a stick that you brought home for... Reasons. One is a $2000 knife. And the last one is a $5000 single use weapon you need for your work. I dunno, a bazooka? Why you would need it for work is beyond me, but you get my gist.

What's the first thing you do to keep yourself safe? You'd pick up the big stick. It's free, and it usually works. That's where the snake hides from you. It doesn't expend any energy and the vast majority of the time humans just walk right past it.

If the stick doesn't work, what would you do? You would use the knife. It could get damaged and you're closer into the intruder, but it's likely to intimidate them more. That's a snake's threat display. Looking big and striking out at you. The human is now aware that they're in danger and often they will run away. If the snake bites you, it will likely not envenomate.

But if the intruder is still not getting the point, you pick up the bazooka. You know you're about to waste $5k on this guy and you will need to save up again for this weapon and you're out of work, which impacts your ability to feed yourself. It's absolutely a last option. This is venom for snakes. Venom is so expensive to produce that most snakes lost the ability to produce it. 97% of the world's snake species are non-venomous, which should give you an idea of how much energy it takes to make. Snakes that get milked for antivenon get fed immediately after their milking or the animal will die. So it is quite literally the last thing they will do for defence.

The snake's behaviour suggests to me that the crawling all over you was a threat display, and the bite was dry. Unfortunately, even dry bites can contain a bit of residual venom, which would suggest why you have some blood clotting. If it wasn't dry, you'd know pretty much straight away.

Overall, you did everything correctly. From getting the snake away from you and not killing it, to getting medical attention immediately.",k8kxtl2,1699577183.0,2023-11-10T10:46:23,t3_17rnwo8,t3_17rnwo8,[],0

AFFRICAH,"ED doc here. 

6 broad categories of poisonous snakes, brown snake being one of the most venomous. 

Most snake bites are dry bites, meaning no envenomation.

All bites need to be taken seriously regardless. You cannot tell what bite is dry and what bite will result in envenomation at the immediate point in time unless you display symptoms immediately. It is a waiting game and ensuring you do not develop symptoms and your bloodwork remains ok.

Brown snake bites are often painless. You don't realise you have been bitten. Brown snake envenomation can result in immediate cardiac arrest/ collapse in a small number of people. Most envenomation causes nonspecific nausea, vomiting,  abdo pain. Specifically, it can cause blood to start clotting inside your vessels, which, as you can imagine, is not good. It can also cause muscle damage. If there are any signs of envenomation, you need antivenom.

You cannot give antivenomen willy-nilly because it too has side effects. Namely anaphylaxis and serum sickness. 

Take all snake bites seriously. Get to safety, don't move. Call for help. Immobilise the limb. Ambos and docs know what to do from there.

Prize-Scratch299,"That snake got you a few times. Generally a single bite will be two puncture wounds, but can be a single one or even just a scratch. Multiple holes indicate multiple bites. Eastern Browns can envenomate on each successive bite or none at all. The gaiters probably helped it not get in really deep and  really load up the venom, but instead meant it had a few goes. long pants as well might have helped stop getting you at all as Aussie snakes have reasonably short fangs.

The test results show you were at least mildly envenomated. Wtf is this question even a thing? You should always treat it as if you have had the most serious bite possible. They can kill very quickly without appropriate first aid followed by proper medical treatment. 

The running was a bad idea. Aside from that, you have done the right thing. Don't hesitate to go the full emergencies response for snake bite",k8l2rzp,1699579255.0,2023-11-10T11:20:55,t3_17rnwo8,t3_17rnwo8,[],0

I would have done exactly what you did, although it probably wasn't the best to go running with snake around your ankle because 1) that would scare it even more and if it hadn't bitten you already, it probably would then; and 2) if it had bitten you already, running around is going to get things pumping and get your lymphatic system moving which is going to move the venom around your body.

Blackrose_,"1. Bruh, New Zealand and Australia have reciprocal medical arrangements, so some tax payer monies from Kiwi land probably landed in the hospital's coffers where you are. So no need for the guilts here. Your tax paying ways paved the way for research in to anti-snake venom, which has a number of Australian and Kiwi medical researchers working on cures and what we can do with molecules of interest from snake venom. 

2. There is the possibility of a 'semi' dry-bite. Some snakes aren't able to get their fangs in to you completely and start the envenomation process. Your thick waiters may have absorbed most of the venom, leaving a small amount that managed?? to be absorbed in to tissues, via the nick, rather than a full whack of a bite that got injected in to your blood stream.  

3. Brown elapid snakes, are the most venomous in the world. They have a LD factor to them. A hint of this stuff is enough to make you go woozy.

StefanTheNurse,"So you‚Äôre in the hospital, the staff (medical or nursing, doesn‚Äôt matter for this point) will be in touch with a clinical toxicologist and be using evidence based protocols to diagnose and treat you.

They‚Äôll be looking at blood results and deciding which part of a pathway to go down, both involve keeping you in for a bit but one side of the pathway involves antivenom as well.

Rest assured, this is what happens to anyone who presents with a suspected bite (and yours is pretty clearly a bite). We do joke that sometimes a stick scratch (‚Äústick bite‚Äù) under the right circumstances results in the same thing‚Ä¶observations, consultation with a toxicologist, blood work‚Ä¶and is generally a good idea because often a stick and a snake have the same presentation and we don‚Äôt want people chasing snakes to prove the point.

So wasted time? Yep, you could maybe be doing something else with your day, and probably didn‚Äôt plan on a hospital trip.

Wasted money? Not really, it‚Äôs better than dying, etc. You aren‚Äôt getting an expensive antivenom unless you need it (hence the blood tests, etc)

Wasted effort on the behalf of the hospital? Nah, that‚Äôs a sunk cost (the staff would be paid either way) and though they wouldn‚Äôt be doing nothing if you weren‚Äôt there (there are always other patients), for the time being you *are* one of the patients, so that‚Äôs ok too.

I'm honestly confused here. Are you the guide  in the outdoor education industry?? how can you not be versed in snake protocol? 

I'm getting the impression your from NZ and are guiding here is that correct?

Surely a coworker/employer told you one of your  hazards in the field is snakes?

The basic st John first aid also cover bites but being in the outdoor industry I'd suggest a remote/wilderness first aid. Your employer should be able to help with it. This is also a requirement if your working with people in this field.


Don't worry about using our resources mate they are there for use and to be used.

Ive worked in the outdoor industry and have heard  of a trip where  a young lad got bit by 2 tigers snakes and had 17 bites. All where dry. 
Flip side a different story to mates on a hiking trip one stepped over the snake other stepped on it the guy that stepped on the snake didn't get bit but his mate did. This was a small scratch and they didn't think much of it until later he felt I'll.

DarthRegoria,"You definitely didn‚Äôt waste any medical resources. You did pretty much everything right, and everything you did seeking treatment was right. 

The mistakes were running when you had the snake wrapped around your leg (but I can only imagine how fucking scary that was, and instinct takes over. Your instinct was to get the fuck away from the snake. I can‚Äôt say I wouldn‚Äôt have done the same, although I‚Äôm more likely to freeze with fear. Even in the wrong situations though, so definitely not more helpful). Ideally, you stay still and if the snake doesn‚Äôt give up and bugger off after a while when you‚Äôre still, try to get it off with a stick or something. Maybe your other shoe/ boot. Definitely not your hands. Then, when the snake is gone, or you‚Äôre safely away from the snake, check for injuries and call 000 as soon as you found the bite marks. Honestly any marks and I would have called 000. It wouldn‚Äôt have been a waste to call 000 even if you didn‚Äôt have obvious bite marks just to check what to do. This isn‚Äôt the US, we don‚Äôt leave people to possibly die from treatable medical issues because it‚Äôs cheaper. 

There are several points from here where the professionals who make these judgements for a living would have declined you care if you didn‚Äôt need it, or weren‚Äôt in a potentially life threatening situation that needed to be monitored in hospital.  

1. The 000 call. If they didn‚Äôt think it was possible/ likely you were bitten by a brown snake, they wouldn‚Äôt have sent the ambulance. 

2. When the ambos arrived. They assessed you at the scene and determined you needed treatment, and that you needed to be taken to hospital. 

3. Hospital admission. They are probably able to do a better, more thorough assessment of your injury, bloodwork and general condition because they have so much more equipment and tests they can do. If the doctors thought it wasn‚Äôt necessary to monitor you for as long as they did, you wouldn‚Äôt have been admitted to hospital, or you would have been discharged earlier. 

The right move after encountering a brown snake and finding what look like bite marks (honestly any brown snake in Australia, because it can be pretty hard to identify the harmless ones from the fuck you up kind) is to seek medical attention, and follow their advice. That‚Äôs what you did. The emergency dispatchers, ambos and doctors all thought you needed to be in hospital, so they got you there.

Same thing happened to my brother in law.
He was walking through long grass to get down to a river to do some fly fishing, feels something hit his ankle through the rubber waders he was wearing and sees a tail of a tiger snake slithering off.

Thinks to himself 'did I get bit?'

Thinks I don't think so but tells his dad who he is fishing with 'hey... this just happened. I'm fine.... I think'

Checks waders, no holes, checks ankle and has what can only be described as a graze on the skin. Can't tell if it was there before or not... it like he got scratched by a cat claw. I have seen the pic. It looks like nothing.

15 minutes later he starts feeling weird...but can't tell if it is just shock or not.

His dad says 'nah....lets go get you checked out'

15 minutes after a high speed dash to local regional hospital gets tested and treated for 24 hours. Venom is present on the skin but symptoms are very minor.

End theory is that the waders thick rubber prevented the tiger snake getting a full bite into his leg....but it tried.

Simple_Purple_9668,"Do exactly as you did. Snake venom may have a combination of neurotoxins, hemotoxins, cardiotoxins, cytotoxins, and myotoxins, depending on the snake that bites you. Neurotoxins will case rapid onset of symptoms that people associate with a snake bite, but the others can produce symptoms that could still kill you or make you very sick without the classic snakebite signs. For example, hemotoxins will alter clotting ability of the blood, so potentially you could develop a fatal bleed (kind of like a hemophiliac). Myotoxins can produce a myopathy with the breakdown products having the potential to cause renal failure. Symptoms from other toxins can take days to develop, but in the interim you do want to be monitored to catch any abnormalities. Complicating things is that the type of snake may be unknown to predict what symptoms you might be at risk of. Snake colour is a poor indicator of species, so what you think is a Brown Snake may not be a Brown Snake. For example, the King Brown or Mulga Snake, whilst visually brown, belongs to the black snake family.",k8o6kl3,1699637371.0,2023-11-11T03:29:31,t3_17rnwo8,t3_17rnwo8,['k8oia6b'],1

None,"It's always better safe than sorry when it comes to snacks, best case scenario, you rock  up to er,  get checked out and sent on your way in less than an hour. Having being kept back for so long for blood tests, and having blood clot particuletes, it was for a good reason and they must have identified you may have some slight  venom in you. Now it doesn't look like a proper bite, but in the chaos of you running, it could of slightly penetrated your skin after biting the boot (I wasn't there so I can be positive on anything, just going of a whim, your story and your image), it wasn't able to bite deep or long enough due to you running or it's fangs could of just scratched you. But don't don't feel bad for the resources that were used for you, it's what the Medicare system is there for, you did the right thing, and you're  lucky you didn't need anti-venom treatment, so you probably didn't get a full dose of the venom in that little scuffle. But as I said before, the nurses and doctors or some specialist recognised the symptoms of the venom  for you to have been held back and tested. And you knew enough to bandage it properly and call 000. 

Although, I'm pretty stunned if had gotten through your gaiters  tbh. But I reckon wearing, high top hiking boots, with gaiters and longe jeans.

TheChromaBristlenose,"Some form of serum sickness happens in the majority of antivenom recipients, since the body doesn't like having foreign horse antibodies injected into it. The symptoms are generally mild (fever, muscle aches, rashes, etc.), and not long-lasting.

However, there is also quite a high risk of anaphylaxis, worsened if the patient is young, has had antivenom before, or requires a high dosage. A foreign study put the figure at \~47% of patients requiring adrenaline after antivenom. I don't think the figure is quite so high in Australia, but still a very significant concern.

Cost aside, that's generally the reason why antivenom is considered a last resort. It's never administered pre-emptively, and doctors will wait until you begin to exhibit symptoms (in case of a dry bite) before giving you any. 

If you actually have been envenomated, symptom reversal with antivenom is almost immediate, so there's little to worry about as long as it's on hand.",k8l1f7d,1699578688.0,2023-11-10T11:11:28,t3_17rnwo8,t1_k8klgfk,[],0

Petulant_Platypus,"The problem with antivenins is that they can induce serum sickness, ideally you want to target a specific snake - here in Victoria, we don‚Äôt routinely do VDK‚Äôs so we rely on known species of snakes - in our case Eastern Brown and the Tiger Snake.  Clinically a tiger snake bite is more likely to appear with paralysis first, specifically the facial muscles, an Eastern Brown you start bleeding first - BUT, that is not reliable as both snakes can induce both effects.

So clinically if we suspected envenomation and had correlating evidence we would give the patient Brown snake or a tiger snake antivenin.  You can give both at once if necessary, sometimes it takes multiple doses and the dose is venom dependant - so a baby gets the same dose as an adult.  

Polyvalent antivenin certainly exists and is given if there are multiple species or venomous snakes in the local area or where you were when you were bitten.

I grew up in a rural area.

1. Don't go stepping over random logs without being mindful what's on the other side. Fallen trees/logs are often used as shelter by wildlife, not to mention the above scenario. Most snakes I saw as a kid when camping etc were in similar scenarios to the above. 

2. In the event of a snake, don't move. Stay still, instruct others to stay still. The snake will leave - it doesn't want to be near you.

3. If you get bitten, you don't move. You bandage the limb to limit circulation and get transport to you - or failing that, you get moved to the transport.

mad_marbled,"Snake's energy/activity levels are linked to their temperature. Their digestion has an optimal temperature level and also a minimum temp level before it begins to occur. So typically in the mornings, they will seek somewhere to sun themselves until they raise their core temp up to ""ideal"" to aid with any remaining digestion and allow them to be in a high functioning state in order to successfully hunt for food. The further they are from ideal temp, the more sluggish and slower moving they will be. That doesn't mean they will be moving at a snails pace, it just means that they won't detect your approach from as far away as they can in ideal circumstances. This is when you are most likely to have a close encounter and if they've determined it is too late to flee they will prepare to defend themselves. This possible scenario won't be limited to the A.M. though. If it's been overcast for the morning and the sun has only appeared after lunch, you may encounter a snake in a not yet warmed up state then. Surface temperature is important for reptiles, and direct sunlight will create surface temperatures higher than the ambient air temp. Consider an asphalt road over the course of a summer day, it only becomes unbearably hot once it has been in direct sunlight for a period of time.

Then, as you've noted the days it is too hot also offers a risk, many snakes (and reptiles in general) will slow down in an attempt to prevent overheating. Now instead of lying on a flat rock in the sun, they will seek one in the shade that they can flatten themselves against it in an attempt to wick away excess heat. Water sources are particularly attractive for almost any animal on a hot day and will make an ideal spot to hunt for food. If they have eaten well that day, this will also affect their reaction time and increase the chance of an encounter.

So the best times to avoid encountering a snake will typically be:

* Early morning before the sun has begun to warm anything it touches. 

* During the peak midday heat, snakes will have warmed up sufficiently to begin hunting or if it's too hot they will seek out shelter until it cools. So they will be less likely to be out in open areas. That said, if they are hunting, they will be where the food is usually found. So consider what the common diet is for the species you are likely to encounter in your area and where it would find its food.

* Very few venomous species are nocturnal, so again open areas have a lower risk in the evening. Keep in mind, if it has been very hot during the course of the day, a snake could have had to seek shelter from the heat and may be finding its way home later than usual. (Yes, snakes do have preferred places they will return to sleep.)",k8marv1,1699601785.0,2023-11-10T17:36:25,t3_17rnwo8,t1_k8l6rr0,['k8mgsso'],1

Ok_Reindeer__1,"Even with everything you just mentioned, I doubt the actual costs of materials and labour should be that much. Maybe for like, 4 weeks of care? There's too much gouging based on demand and initial setup costs (education/equipment). Stop letting education franchises charge stupid amounts for your future earning capacity and boosting the amounts everyone has to charge to recoup it. Especially such emotional/imperitive driven needs/demands where people will do whatever they can even if it's exploitative. 

I know this is opinionated and possibly wrong, but it just seems crazy to me some things cost so much. It's gonna be all about the cost of research and stuff, fund the future etc. right? That's the usual. So that's why I'd like to be proven the actual costs of those things to see where the true gap is. If it doesn't actually add up or is conflated where it doesn't need to happen that way, fuck the system. I'm betting most of the chunk is aggregate charge like 'in hospital care' and the actual technical items will be like a few 100.

tcgtms,"I can answer this because I'm a vet.

Yes, the timing in the last 15 years saw both rise at the same time. It's really not driven and increased insurance uptake is more of an outcome.

The reason is that people genuinely expect more from the profession than before, and we can provide more than what we could for the last 20 years.

In the past for a snake bite situation, we might give a dog antiserum after a consult and then put them on a drip overnight without supervision or maybe we would have someone check on the dog every 6 hours overnight.

Nowadays, if the patient is admitted to an ICU, they would be under 24/7 care with primary vet, hospital vets, nursing teams with better testing and better treatment and honestly, more frequent and transparent communication which all results in better patient outcome - but at a price.

In my opinion, it's the expectation from the public -> capability of vets -> increased pricing -> demand for insurance. Capability of vets took a long time to catch up to people's expectations but it's definitely getting there now with all major referral hospitals having access to specialists with way more training than your GP vets, and diagnostics facilities such as advanced imaging.",k8kyxe5,1699577643.0,2023-11-10T10:54:03,t3_17rnwo8,t1_k8kxu1n,"['k8pl46k', 'k8qejbl']",2

glimmer67,"Correct - that was opinionated and wrong.

Let‚Äôs start with universities. The degree is incredibly expensive to run. Where I studied, I know that each year they LOST 20k per student, so get the law school to cover the rest. In a law degree, you have 300 paying students in a lecture theatre with one staff person. My vet degree was 6 years and was 50% lectures, 50% hands on in small groups - animal handling practicals at university owned and funded clinics and farms, anatomy labs, surgery classes, one on one consultation tutorials, countless others‚Ä¶ with a little thought, I‚Äôm sure you can appreciate that the training required for vets would make the degree extraordinarily expensive. We don‚Äôt pay the researchers salaries btw, not sure about other faculties but I know it doesn‚Äôt work that way in vet.

Now in regards to vet bills - this may shock you, but the majority of clinics actually undercharge. The advanced level of service provided is now not that far off human medicine. Australians just don‚Äôt know how much health care costs though, because of beautiful Medicare. Any single one of the fees listed in the thread above would be 5-6x that cost if it was in the human world, but we don‚Äôt see the price because of Medicare.

I see the ins and outs of clinic finances. There‚Äôs no secret greedy man. Nurses are paid dirt (53-57k). Vets are paid crap - starting salary 60k, CAREER average 80-100k. This is for a profession that is on par with doctors and lawyers in education level. 

I find this emotional because every day I do everything I can to help people‚Äôs animals. Myself and my colleagues are paid like shit for it, then we get slammed by clients for being greedy, inconsiderate money suckers. That takes a huge toll when it‚Äôs every single day.

Working conditions and salaries are improving quite rapidly at the moment though. There are enough vets burnt out and fed up (50% leave the industry within 5 years of graduating) that clinic owners are having to charge fees that are higher and closer to what they should be for the actual level of service provided.

I would say that for the level of medicine provided, vet bills are inexpensive. But I understand most people think they‚Äôre expensive. Regardless, the bottom line is, don‚Äôt get a pet without understanding the risks and the potential fees involved.

PrinceoR-,"I've heard from a couple of Aboriginal people that that was how they treated snake bites before settlement. If you got bit, you move calmly (hopefully) away from the snake and as soon as you can just lay down and don't move, until you feel 100% fine. Sometimes they would lay there for a day or more, but I guess it's better to be hungry than dead. 

Also in coastal areas Aboriginal people used Cassurinas (the little pine tree looking trees with thick needle bed underneath) to protect against snakes. The pine needles have barbs where each segment joins and those barbs catch in a snakes scales, which they don't like. So snakes avoid Cassurinas needles, which makes them a good place to sleep or look after kids etc.",k8mss7b,1699615776.0,2023-11-10T21:29:36,t3_17rnwo8,t1_k8lcqim,"['k8wpum3', 'k90ehln']",2

tcgtms,"Yeah it's a tough one - I tend to be on the ""pragmatic"" side a bit more these days as well but we have to be really careful not to mislead the clients as well because as GPs we don't always know what is heroic vs what is practical from referral care. 

For example, we often think chemotherapy for cancer is often a lost cause and a wild goose chase at a first instance, but certain types of lymphoma have a worthwhile chance of chemo which is fairly painless and it can be curative as a cancer can be. Would I know how to navigate through the complexity as a GP? Definitely not unfortunately. So, for certain issues, we may end up referring to specialist care with a bit of forewarning just to set their expectations correctly, because they don't often have the magic bullet - but it doesn't hurt to ask for their opinion in these circumstances.

NotedChef,"Distinguishing a baby snake from a worm can be challenging because baby snakes can sometimes resemble worms due to their small size and similar appearance. Here are some key differences to look for:

1. Movement: Baby snakes will typically move in a more coordinated, slithering fashion, while worms move by contracting and expanding their bodies.

2. Scales: Baby snakes have scales on their bodies, which give them a rough texture, whereas worms are smooth and lack scales.

3. Head shape: Snakes have distinct heads with eyes, whereas worms have a more uniform, cylindrical body without a visible head.

4. Coloration: Baby snakes often have patterns and colors that can vary depending on the species, whereas worms are usually a single, uniform color.

5. Eyes: Baby snakes have eyes, which are visible as small dark spots, while worms lack eyes.

If you encounter a small, unfamiliar creature and are unsure of its identity, it's always best to observe from a safe distance and avoid handling it, as some baby snakes can be venomous.",k7ctpch,1698841378.0,2023-11-01T22:22:58,t3_17l684l,t3_17l684l,[],0

**Verreaux‚Äôs Skink**

[https://wildlifeqld.com.au/verreauxs-skink/](https://wildlifeqld.com.au/verreauxs-skink/)

*Verreaux‚Äôs Skink is worm or snake-like in appearance with a long body and short weak limbs, each of which have 3 digits and reduced to clawed stumps in the hindquarters. Brown to grey on the top with a creamy-yellow band across the base of the head. This band is more prominent in juveniles and tends to fade with age.*  
  
*Distinguished from snake by:*  
*Presence of movable eyelids,*  
*Fleshy tongue (not forked),*  
*Fore limbs present,*  
*Hind limbs present although greatly reduced in comparison to fore limbs,*  
*Ear openings.*  
*Average length:*  
*300mm with records of individuals in excess of 350mm.*  
  
*Habitat in SE Qld:*  
*Prefers more humid habitats such as wet sclerophyll forests, rainforest margins, vine thickets and coastal scrubs. Tolerant of habitat disturbance, it thrives in compost heaps and gardens in suburbia, and beneath logs in open paddocks.*  
  
*Diet:*  
*Feeds on ground dwelling insects.*  
  
*Local Distribution:*  
*Successful in all Brisbane suburbs.*  
  
*Around the home:*  
*Most specimens are found after turning loose soil or grass clippings, discovered by a roaming cat or scurrying from the lawn mower from within long grass. Often found in numbers within prime locations such as compost heaps. They are inoffensive and should simply be released within the confines of your yard in heavy cover such as mulch or under a dense shrub preferably at night.*",k7c4xoa,1698822826.0,2023-11-01T17:13:46,t3_17l684l,t1_k7c3rhx,"['k7c5c0s', 'k7fglfi', 'k7c9pka']",3

McMetm,The biggest obstacle you'll face is affordable housing. You haven't spoken in your post about your budget but the capital cities are formidably expensive. I've travelled around and I like the rurban cities. Big enough to have the services but friendly and laid back. Towns like Mt Gambier or Albany sized. Then you've got to try and see it to find which bit suits you. Which is an undertaking. Lots of space. Long distances. As a midwife and being in IT there's tons of work.

Melbourne could basically steal the Wellington slogan ‚Äúcan‚Äôt beat Melbourne on a nice day‚Äù - we also get crappy long winters. Best culture though. We have about 50 ‚ÄòCuba Street‚Äô vibe streets.

Sydney‚Äôs shit, Brisbane is nice, with good weather. Adelaide is pleasant, but perhaps only to visit. If you think you‚Äôll miss the bird life of Welly I‚Äôd probably go for Brissy or Newcastle. Brissy probably better for the kids? I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre into.

PinkGayWhale,"I agree with this and I have had wasps in my wall cavity.   You want to find where they are entering and exiting, probably on the outside of the house..   It is likely to be a tiny gap possibly at the edge of a window frame or where the eaves meet the wall.   There are likely to be several wasps crowding near the entrance.
You should be able to get ""wasp powder"" from Bunnings in a puffer style plastic bottle.

Luckily he had someone with him. They jumped in the car and belted towards the closest hospital.

Booked Perth to Hobart return as they offer direct flights. On the way to the airport at 7.30am we had a text to say the flight to Hobart was cancelled and we were bumped to a red eye flight that night with a 4hr stopover on Sydney. Excellent. We now waste a day of accommodation and car hire. 
At 7pm that evening we receive another text. Red eye flight now cancelled and we‚Äôre pushed to a flight the next day with an overnight stopover and arriving Hobart over 48hrs after initially planned. 
Not good enough we cancelled the outbound flights and flew with Qantas - still arriving late and losing out on accomodation/car hire. After some arguing we got a refund from virgin - they wanted to give us a credit. 
Departing Hobart for Perth - same thing happens - flight is cancelled with only a few hours notice. Again, no direct flights and stupidly long stopover. At this point, we were desperate to get home and couldn‚Äôt trust further cancellations wouldn‚Äôt happen again so we cancelled and went with Qantas (again losing out on money as flights were last minute and time). 
Virgin refused to refund these fares - they kept insisting we purchased the tickets with a travel credit - we had not, all tickets purchased on same credit card at the same time. 
Ground staff refuses to help and wouldn‚Äôt even look at us - just kept typing away on keyboard looking busy. 
3 phone calls and 2 hours later we managed to establish when the first tickets were cancelled the whole lot was refunded to a travel credit then return flights re-issued.

JoeSchmeau,"They did something similar with my parents, who were attempting to fly from Phoenix to Sydney with Qantas. The itinerary was simple enough, PHX to LAX operated by American Airlines, then LAX to SYD operated by Qantas, all booked directly through Qantas some 8 months prior to travel day.

About a month before the flight, they get a notice saying their itinerary had a slight change, they were still flying PHX to LAX but their next flight had been changed to SFO (San Francisco!) to SYD. So somehow they were supposed to arrive in LA and then 3.5 hours later fly out of San Francisco.

My dad called them up and tried to get it sorted, took a bit over a week to get fixed, all seemed okay. On travel day they took their flight from Phoenix to LA without issue, but when they went to wait by their gate for the next flight they received a message saying their LAX to SYD flight had changed its itinerary and they were now expected to fly SFO to SYD in about 3 hours.

They immediately went to speak to the Qantas staff who told them the flight hadn't changed at all and in their system it showed that my parents had valid ticket bookings for both the LAX to SYD and SFO to SYD flights. They'd already been checked through the whole itinerary at the desk in Phoenix and their bags were checked through to SYD, so they just got on the plane there in LAX, arrived in Sydney and got their bags, and had a pleasant trip.

IllustriousCarrot537,"If you in an area with a lot of venomous snakes, be vigilant when moving rubbish bins or other places they might get behind and hide, don't stick your hand/fingers where you can't see and be careful getting into car etc. 
Keep grass cut short so you can see where your walking and always be aware of where your walking in the summer months. Avoid walking where you can't see and if you have to, wear jeans and preferably gumboots and don't walk softly. It's also an idea to have an elastic snake bandage just in case.
It's also a good idea (do gooders, Karen's and others won't agree) to keep a few sharp spades or better still a long handled hoe or 3 strategically placed if you have a larger property. Especially if you have an area where kids play etc.
A 12g is by far the best option.
It's also a damn good idea to enroll dogs in a snake avoidance course as they tend to want to play/eat snakes and it never ends well.
If you don't have kids, livestock or pets, the best option is always simply to leave them alone and give em a wide berth. Some are pretty nasty like the brown snakes in Qld, who will actually pursue a threat, others like the tigers will generally try and get away rather than assume a defensive position.
Biggest risk is stepping on one. If one does ever assume a defensive posture, be aware they can strike about half their body length and it's usually best to keep perfectly still.

We handle them inside, but we don't let them roam around on the floor. We have cats & it's not worth risking the snakes well-being. They roam outside on sunny days.
The tanks are set up for heating & light dependant on each animals individual needs. They generally shed just before a feed. The kids have a huge jar that they keep the skins in. It interesting to pull them out & see the growth comparisons. 
Snakes don't hibernate. They brumate. We turn the heat down over cooler months & lessen their feeds.
No problem. Reptile keeping is an interesting hobby & it's nice when people are keen to learn about them. They're wonderful.
